<h1>Hi, I'm Kyle! </h1>

A bit about this page and myself: I am embarking on my cloud engineering journey! I love the versatility of cloud, and how it's at the intersection of so many different domains of information technology. I have experience in network security Professional Services, I am a certified Fortinet and Palo Alto Instructor, and I have worked as a penetration tester.
